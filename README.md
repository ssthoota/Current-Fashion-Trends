    <p> I have always had an <strong> insatiable </strong> passion for food. When I was little, opening a restaurant that encompassed many foods of different cultures and regions was so extraordinary to me. During the pandemic, I furthered my passion for cooking, and have learned to love the process, <em> as well as the outcome </em> I also just love puns in general, so hopefully with this imaginary menu, I can share my humorous vision one plate at a time! </p>
